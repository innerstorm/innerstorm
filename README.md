### Hi, Thomas here! ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a Frontend Developer with over a decade of experience in the world of web development. 
I've had the privilege of working with a wide range of technologies and frameworks. 

ðŸš€ My primary focus lies in crafting user interfaces using *JavaScript*, *React*, *VueJS*, *HTML*, and *CSS*, where I thrive in creating seamless, user-friendly, mobile responsive web applications.

ðŸ‘¯ In addition to my frontend skills, I've had the opportunity working with frameworks like *Laravel* or *Symfony*, which has provided me with a well-rounded perspective on web application development.

ðŸ”­ When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy tinkering with my homelab and extend its hardware capabilities. I like to experiment with projects on Raspberry Pi hardware making it beep boop with  Python and all that's Linux. Yeah, and I make music sometimes. 

ðŸŒŸ Here you can find some of the projects I'm working on, always learning new technologies, putting it together bit by bit.
